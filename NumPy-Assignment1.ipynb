    "Ans. Vectorization in NumPy\n",
    "Vectorization in NumPy refers to the ability to perform operations on entire arrays, rather than iterating through each element one by one. This approach allows NumPy to apply operations element-wise in compiled, optimized code instead of interpreted Python code, leading to faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Vectorization:\n",
    "  * Improved performance: Operations are executed more efficiently using low-level, compiled C code.\n",
    "  * Simplified code: Eliminates the need for explicit loops, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n",

    "Broadcasting in NumPy\n",
    "Broadcasting is a technique that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without needing explicit reshaping or replication of the arrays. NumPy automatically adjusts the shape of the smaller array to match the larger array's shape in a way that minimizes memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Broadcasting Works:\n",
    "  * When performing operations between arrays of different shapes, NumPy compares their shapes starting from the rightmost dimension. If the dimensions are compatible (either they are the same or one of them is 1), broadcasting occurs.\n",
    "  * If the arrays' shapes are not compatible, NumPy raises an error.\n",

    "Contributions to Efficient Array Operations\n",
    "1. Performance Improvement:\n",
    "   * Vectorization allows for operations to be carried out without explicit loops, resulting in faster execution.\n",
    "   * Broadcasting enables operations on arrays of different shapes without duplicating data in memory, thus improving efficiency.\n",
    "2. Simplification of Code:\n",
    "   * Both techniques allow for cleaner and more concise code, removing the need for manual iteration or reshaping of arrays\n",
    "3. Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "   * Broadcasting reduces memory usage by avoiding the creation of large intermediate arrays and by performing operations directly on the smaller array's shape.\n",
    "4. Reduction in Python Overhead:\n",
    "   * With vectorization, the need for Python loops is eliminated, reducing the overhead of interpreted code and significantly enhancing performance."
